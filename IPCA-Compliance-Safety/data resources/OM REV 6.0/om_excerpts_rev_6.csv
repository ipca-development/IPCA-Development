5. MINIMUM EQUIPMENT LIST (MEL)

EuroPilot Center does not apply operational procedures in accordance with NCO.IDE.A.105 to dispatch an aircraft with inoperative equipment through a Minimum Equipment List (MEL).

Alternatively, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2042/2003, M.A.403, any defect that hazards seriously the flight safety shall be rectified before further flight.

Only authorized certifying staff (maintenance engineers) may decide whether an aircraft defect hazards seriously the flight safety and therefore decide when and which rectification action shall be taken before further flight and which defect rectification can be deferred.

Any aircraft defect that would not hazard seriously the flight safety shall be rectified as soon as practicable after the date the defect was first identified and within any limits specified in the maintenance data.

Any defect not rectified before flight shall be recorded in the aircraft maintenance record system and all deferred defects shall be made known to the pilot / flight crew via the paper and electronic Trouble Report.

Deferred defects shall be transferred by maintenance onto worksheets at the next appropriate maintenance check.

Any deferred defect which is not rectified during the maintenance check shall be re-entered onto a new deferred defect record sheet.

The original date of the defect shall be retained.

The necessary components or parts needed for rectification shall be made available or ordered on a priority basis and fitted at the earliest opportunity.

Note:
As EuroPilot Center has no MEL procedure in place, the decision to defer an aircraft defect cannot be taken by the Pilot-in-Command but must be taken by an authorized maintenance engineer.
The decision to dispatch the aircraft after an item has been deferred lies with the Pilot-in-Command.

when multiplied by 1,3 not exceed Accelerate Stop Distance Available (ASDA)
when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed Take Off Distance Available (TODA)
Note: It is EuroPilot Center policy not to take off with tailwind.
The Take Off distance for the DA42 can be determined via the tables in the POH. Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart at the next higher value of weight, altitude and temperature. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.
We refer to the DA42 POH, Section 5 - Performance.

In addition to the field length requirements, a Multi Engine Airplane should also consider the obstacle clearance requirements:

The pilot in command must ensure that take-off flight path should clear all obstacles by a vertical margin of at least 50 ft, or by a horizontal distance of at least 90 m plus 0,125 x D, where D is the horizontal distance travelled by the Airplane from the end of the take-off distance available or the end of the take-off distance if a turn is scheduled before the end of the take-off distance available except as provided in (b) and (c) below.
For Airplanes with a wingspan of less than 60 m such as rhe DA42, a horizontal obstacle clearance of half the Airplane wingspan (6,71 meter) plus 60 m, plus 0,125 x D may be used.
When showing compliance with this subparagraph it must be assumed that:
The take-off flight path begins at a height of 50 ft above the surface at the end of the take-off distance required and ends at a height of 1 500 ft above the surface;
The Airplane is not banked before the Airplane has reached a height of 50 ft above the surface, and that thereafter the angle of bank does not exceed 15°;
Failure of the critical engine occurs at the point on the all engine take-off flight path where visual reference for the purpose of avoiding obstacles is expected to be lost;
The gradient of the take-off flight path from 50 ft to the assumed engine failure height is equal to the average all- engine gradient during climb and transition to the en-route configuration, multiplied by a factor of 0,77; and
The gradient of the take-off flight path from the height reached in accordance with subparagraph 4 above to the end of the take-off flight path is equal to the one engine inoperative en-route climb gradient shown in the Airplane Flight Manual.
When showing compliance with subparagraph (a) above for those cases where the intended flight path does not require track changes of more than 15°, the Pilot in command need not consider those obstacles which have a lateral distance greater than:",OM_REV_6.0_CANONICAL_PART_3.txt,fba35d31a7d08c79b07ff0bca8dc979e7e6e62aac3ef0f548e2e8b8fce250c3b

The flight training schedule covers the planning of the students, instructors and the training fleet.

The flight training schedule is established on a monthly basis, offering both students and instructors more security and a better way to combine flying activities with a private and professional life.

The following scheduling procedure is applied:

Step 1: before the 20th of each month, all instructional staff provides their availabilities for the coming month through the online planning system.
Step 2: around the 20th of each month, an e-mail is sent out by the Chief Operations Officer to all students with the available dates for training for the upcoming month.
Step 3: each individual student feedback is processed, and temporary training slots are allocated in the online planning system. A draft schedule is produced, and completed or modified depending on the feedback from all students.
Step 4: on the 23rd a reminder is sent out to the students who haven’t replied yet.
Step 5: when the schedule is almost complete (usually around the 24th), an e-mail is sent out to each student individually, including a personal training schedule.
Step 6: upon receipt of final confirmation by the student, the training slots are saved into the online planning system. An aircraft, training device and instructor are allocated to the training slot.
Step 7: for each flight training session, a training device (FSTD) is allocated as far as practicable (color green), offering a backup in case of adverse weather conditions.

Changes to the schedule throughout the month can only be performed by the Chief Operations Officer or Operations Officer.

Note 1: In no event should any Flight or Theoretical Knowledge Instructor alter the monthly schedule as this will lead to loss of overview and efficiency.

Note 2: Students are never allowed to reserve training slots with instructor directly via the online planning system, with the exception of self-practice FSTD sessions, which the student may reserve directly (color code blue) via the online planning system. A restriction of maximum 2 hours per student is applicable in order to guarantee every student sufficient self-practice time on the FSTD’s.

Note 3: Flight training sessions on the FSTD (with instructors) always have priority over self-practice FSTD sessions.",OM_REV_6.0_CANONICAL_PART_1.txt,a5360a87dfc91bd466821be79d7324ced900ab9d2309d4870e8caa62f6283e16

A Duty is any task that a student or instructor is required to carry out associated with the business of an AOC holder or an ATO.

A Duty Period is a period which starts when a student or instructor is required by an operator or an ATO to commence a duty and ends when they are free from all duties.

A Flight Duty Period is any time during which a student or instructor operates in an aircraft as a member of its crew.

The Flight Duty Period starts when the student or instructor is required by an Operator or an ATO to report for a flight or a series of flights; it finishes at the end of the last flight on which he or she is an operating crew member.

A Rest Period is an uninterrupted and defined period of time during which a student or instructor is free from all duties.

The Home Base is the location nominated by EuroPilot Center to the student or instructor from where they normally start and end a Flight Duty Period and where EuroPilot Center is not responsible for their accommodation.

Antwerp Airport (EBAW) is considered as the Home Base for EuroPilot Center.

Instructors or students performing Flight Duties for other Operators or ATO’s are at all times responsible to inform EuroPilot Center about these Flight Duties.

They must ensure that they do not operate an EuroPilot Center aircraft if they know that they have not had sufficient rest or they are suffering from or are likely to suffer from fatigue or feel unfit, to the extent that the flight may be endangered.

PED’s with lithium batteries are capable of ignition and subsequent explosion due to overheating. Overheating may be caused by shorting, rapid discharge or overcharging.

Overheating results in thermal runaway, which is a chemical reaction within the battery causing the internal temperature and pressure to rise.

This produces a fire that repeatedly flares up as each battery cell in turn ruptures and releases its contents.

Fighting a fire that contains either disposable or rechargeable lithium battery cells requires:

Extinguishment of the fire; and
Cooling of the remaining cells to stop the thermal runaway.

Water is the most effective coolant.

Halon, Halon replacement and/or water fire extinguishers should be used for initial knockdown of these fires, followed by immediate dousing with water from any available source.

Note: Do not use fire resistant burn bags to isolate burning lithium-type batteries. Transferring a burning appliance into a burn bag may be extremely hazardous.

Do not move the device until you are certain the fire is extinguished and the device is cool.

The PIC may commence an instrument approach regardless of the reported runway visual range/visibility (RVR/VIS).

If the reported RVR/VIS is less than the applicable minimum, the approach shall not be continued:
• Below 1.000 ft above the aerodrome; or
• Into the final approach segment in the case where the decision altitude/height (DA/H) or minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) is more than 1.000 ft above the aerodrome.

Where the RVR is not available, RVR values may be derived by converting the reported visibility as described under 4.2.5.4.

If, after passing 1.000 ft above the aerodrome, the reported RVR/VIS falls below the applicable minimum, the approach may be continued to DA/H or MDA/H.

The approach may be continued below DA/H or MDA/H and the landing may be completed provided that the visual reference adequate for the type of approach operation and for the intended runway is established at the DA/H or MDA/H and is maintained.

Take off minima must be expressed as visibility or RVR limits, taking into account all relevant factors for each aerodrome planned to be used and the Aircraft characteristics. Where there is a specific need to see and avoid obstacles on departure and/or for a forced landing, additional conditions (e.g. ceiling) must be specified.

Since the only Landing requirement for a Single Engine aircraft is the Field Length, the Pilot In Command must ensure that:

The landing distance, from a screen height of 50 ft, must not exceed 70 % of the Landing Distance Available (LDA), i.e. a factor of 1,43.
If the landing surface is grass up to 20 cm long on firm soil, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
If the METAR or TAF or combination of both indicate that the runway may be wet at the estimated time of arrival, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
The landing distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% downslope. No allowance is permitted for upslope.

The Landing Distance for the C172SP can be determined via the tables in the POH, keeping in mind that distances shown are based on the short field landing technique. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.

Scan flows are performed from top to bottom and from left to right. Every instrument and switch in the cockpit is checked in a logical order and the required actions are performed for the relevant phase of flight. Scan flows can be performed both on the ground and in flight.

Read-and-do checklists are performed only on the ground, with the exception of specific emergency checklists. An item is read out and thereafter the required action is performed.

Recall checklists are performed by heart. All in-flight checklists are recall checklists and must be known by heart at all times.

All checklists must be carried out loud and clear and announced, for example “Before Start Checklist”, and finished with “Before Start Checklist Completed”.",OM_REV_6.0_CANONICAL_PART_2.txt,8309103e751626a5b89ade6a47ed420174dc7e52a5ee8f1e90c801698e27e342
