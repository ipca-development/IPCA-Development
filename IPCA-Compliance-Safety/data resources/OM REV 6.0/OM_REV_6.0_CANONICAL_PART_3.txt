1. PERFORMANCE

In accordance with NCO.POL.110, the PIC shall only operate the aircraft if the performance is adequate to comply with the applicable rules of the air and any other restrictions applicable to the flight, the airspace or the aerodromes or operating sites used, taking into account the charting accuracy of any charts and maps used.
All the required and complementary performance information applicable to the individual aircraft is provided in the individual POH, Chapter 5.

1.1 Take Off

1.1.1 Take Off performance C172SP
Since the only Take Off requirement for a Single Engine Airplane is the Field Length, the Pilot In Command must ensure that:
When no stopway or clearway is available, the calculated Take Off distance when multiplied by
1.25 must not exceed the Take Off Run Available (TORA) or;
When a stopway and/or clearway is available, the calculated Take Off distance must:
not exceed Take Off Run Available (TORA)
when multiplied by 1,3 not exceed Accelerate Stop Distance Available (ASDA)
when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed Take Off Distance Available (TODA)
Note: Performance characteristics are provided for tailwind Take Offs with maximum 10 Kts. However, it is EuroPilot Center policy not to take off with tailwind.
The Take Off distance for the C172SP can be determined via the tables in the POH, keeping in mind that distances shown are based on the short field technique. Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart at the next higher value of weight, altitude and temperature. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.

1.1.2 Take Off performance DA42
When no stopway or clearway is available, the calculated Take Off distance when multiplied by
1.25 must not exceed the Take Off Run Available (TORA) or;
When a stopway and/or clearway is available, the calculated Take Off distance must:
not exceed Take Off Run Available (TORA)
when multiplied by 1,3 not exceed Accelerate Stop Distance Available (ASDA)
when multiplied by 1.15, not exceed Take Off Distance Available (TODA)
Note: It is EuroPilot Center policy not to take off with tailwind.
The Take Off distance for the DA42 can be determined via the tables in the POH. Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart at the next higher value of weight, altitude and temperature. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.
We refer to the DA42 POH, Section 5 - Performance.

In addition to the field length requirements, a Multi Engine Airplane should also consider the obstacle clearance requirements:

The pilot in command must ensure that take-off flight path should clear all obstacles by a vertical margin of at least 50 ft, or by a horizontal distance of at least 90 m plus 0,125 x D, where D is the horizontal distance travelled by the Airplane from the end of the take-off distance available or the end of the take-off distance if a turn is scheduled before the end of the take-off distance available except as provided in (b) and (c) below.
For Airplanes with a wingspan of less than 60 m such as rhe DA42, a horizontal obstacle clearance of half the Airplane wingspan (6,71 meter) plus 60 m, plus 0,125 x D may be used.
When showing compliance with this subparagraph it must be assumed that:
The take-off flight path begins at a height of 50 ft above the surface at the end of the take-off distance required and ends at a height of 1 500 ft above the surface;
The Airplane is not banked before the Airplane has reached a height of 50 ft above the surface, and that thereafter the angle of bank does not exceed 15°;
Failure of the critical engine occurs at the point on the all engine take-off flight path where visual reference for the purpose of avoiding obstacles is expected to be lost;
The gradient of the take-off flight path from 50 ft to the assumed engine failure height is equal to the average all- engine gradient during climb and transition to the en-route configuration, multiplied by a factor of 0,77; and
The gradient of the take-off flight path from the height reached in accordance with subparagraph 4 above to the end of the take-off flight path is equal to the one engine inoperative en-route climb gradient shown in the Airplane Flight Manual.
When showing compliance with subparagraph (a) above for those cases where the intended flight path does not require track changes of more than 15°, the Pilot in command need not consider those obstacles which have a lateral distance greater than:
300 m, if the flight is conducted under conditions allowing visual course guidance navigation, or if navigational aids are available enabling the pilot to maintain the intended flight path with the same accuracy; or
600 m, for flights under all other conditions.

When showing compliance with subparagraph (a) above for those cases where the intended flight path requires track changes of more than 15°, the pilot in command need not consider those obstacles which have a lateral distance greater than:
600 m for flights under conditions allowing visual course guidance navigation;
900 m for flights under all other conditions.
When showing compliance with subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, the pilot in command must take account of the following:
The mass of the Airplane at the commencement of the take-off run;
The pressure altitude at the aerodrome;
The ambient temperature at the aerodrome; and
Not more than 50 % of the reported head-wind component or not less than 150 % of the reported tail-wind component.


1.2 Enroute / Cruise

The aircraft may not be assumed to be flying above the altitude at which a rate of climb of 300 ft/min is attained.
The net gradient of descent, in the event of engine failure, shall be the gross gradient of descent increased by a gradient of 0.5%
The maximum altitude at which a rate of climb of 300 ft/min is attained (Service Ceiling) is: 14.000 ft.
Net gradient of descent can be determined under:
Chapter 3, Page 26 - Fig 3-1 (Corresponds to: 10,97% or 6,26 degrees in zero wind conditions).

1.2.2 Cruise performance DA42
The aircraft may not be assumed to be flying above the altitude at which a rate of climb of 300 ft/min is attained.
The assumed en-route gradient with one engine inoperative shall be the gross gradient of descent or climb, as appropriate, respectively increased by a gradient of 0,5%, or decreased by a gradient of 0,5%.
We refer to the DA42 POH, Section 5 - Performance.

1.3 Landing

1.3.1 Landing performance C172SP
Since the only Landing requirement for a Single Engine aircraft is the Field Length, the Pilot In Command must ensure that:

The landing distance, from a screen height of 50 ft, must not exceed 70 % of the Landing Distance Available (LDA), i.e. a factor of 1,43.
If the landing surface is grass up to 20 cm long on firm soil, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
If the METAR or TAF or combination of both indicate that the runway may be wet at the estimated time of arrival, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
The landing distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% downslope. No allowance is permitted for upslope.

The Landing Distance for the C172SP can be determined via the tables in the POH, keeping in mind that distances shown are based on the short field landing technique. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.

LM 1.156 Kg Chapter 5, Page 24 - Fig 5-11

Note: It is EuroPilot Center policy not to land with tailwind.



1.3.2 Landing performance DA42
The landing distance, from a screen height of 50 ft, must not exceed 70 % of the Landing Distance Available (LDA), i.e. a factor of 1,43.
If the landing surface is grass up to 20 cm long on firm soil, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
If the METAR or TAF or combination of both indicate that the runway may be wet at the estimated time of arrival, the landing distance should be multiplied by a factor of 1,15.
The landing distance should be increased by 5% for each 1% downslope. No allowance is permitted for upslope.

The Landing Distance for the DA42 can be determined via the tables in the POH. The above mentioned safety margins need to be added.
We refer to the DA42 POH, Section 5 - Performance.

Note: It is EuroPilot Center policy not to land with tailwind.

4.2 IFR Training Flights (Dual)

4.2.1 Aerodrome Operating Minima (NCO.OP.110)
The PIC shall select and use Aerodrome Operating Minima for each:
• Departure Aerodrome;
• Destination Aerodrome;
• Alternate Aerodrome;

With the exception of the Take Off Minima, EuroPilot Center has implemented the calculated Aerodrome Operating Minima published by Jeppesen.

Note: On Jeppesen Approach and Aerodrome charts an inverse printed “Standard” label in the upper left corner of the minimums band indicate they are derived according to the requirements described in EASA Air Operations documents. These minima exceed the state minima.

The PIC shall however always take the following into account:
• The type, performance and handling characteristics of the aircraft;
• His/her competence and experience;
• The dimensions and characteristics of the runways and final approach and take-off areas (FATO’s) that may be selected for use;
• The adequacy and performance of the available visual and non-visual ground aids;
• The equipment available on the aircraft for the purpose of navigation and/or control of the flight path, during the take-off, the approach, the flare, the landing, the rollout and the missed approach;
• The obstacles in the approach, the missed approach and the climb-out areas necessary for the execution of contingency procedures;
• The obstacle clearance altitude/height for the instrument approach procedures;
• The means to determine and report meteorological conditions; and
• The flight technique to be used during the final approach.

The minima for a specific type of approach and landing procedure shall be used if:
• The ground equipment required for the intended procedure is operative;
• The aircraft systems required for the type of approach are operative;
• The required aircraft performance criteria are met; and
• The pilot is qualified appropriately.



EUROPILOT CENTER – IFR TRAINING MINIMA
TYPE | MINIMA | Ref.
TAKE OFF RVR/VIS | 1.500 m | 4.2.4
APPROACH RVR/VIS | JEPPESEN | Approach Plate
VISUAL APPROACH | 800 m | 4.2.5.3



4.2.2 Departure and Approach Procedures (NCO.OP.115)
The PIC shall use the departure and approach procedures established by the State of the aerodrome, if such procedures have been published for the runway or final approach and take-off areas (FATO’s) to be used.

The pilot-in-command may deviate from a published departure route, arrival route or approach procedure:
• Provided obstacle clearance criteria can be observed, full account is taken of the operating conditions and any ATC clearance is adhered to; or
• When being radar-vectored by an ATC unit.



4.2.3 Low Visibility Procedures
EuroPilot Center has no BCAA approval to conduct training operations when Low Visibility Operations are in force in accordance with Annex V (Part-SPA), Subpart E to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012.



4.2.4 Take Off Minima
EuroPilot Center applies the Take Off Minima procedures based on AMC1 NCO.OP.110.

4.2.4.1 General
Take off minima must be expressed as visibility or RVR limits, taking into account all relevant factors for each aerodrome planned to be used and the Aircraft characteristics. Where there is a specific need to see and avoid obstacles on departure and/or for a forced landing, additional conditions (e.g. ceiling) must be specified.

The PIC shall not commence take off unless the weather conditions at the aerodrome of departure are equal to or better than applicable minima for landing at that aerodrome, unless a suitable take off alternate aerodrome is available.

When the reported meteorological visibility is below the required take off minima and RVR is not reported, a take off may only be commenced if the PIC can determine that the RVR/visibility along the take off runway is equal to or better than the required minimum.

When no reported meteorological visibility or RVR are available, a take off may only be commenced if the PIC can determine that the RVR/visibility along the take off runway is equal to or better than the required minimum.

4.2.4.2 Visual reference
The take off minima must be selected to ensure sufficient guidance to control the Aircraft in the event of a discontinued take off in adverse circumstances and a continued take-off after failure of the critical engine.

For night operations, ground lights should be available to illuminate the runway/final approach and take-off area (FATO) and any obstacles.

4.2.4.3 Required RVR/visibility
For multi-engined airplanes, with performance such that in the event of a critical engine failure at any point during take-off the airplane can either stop or continue that take-off to a height of 1.500 ft above the aerodrome while clearing obstacles by the required margins, the take-off minimums specified by the operator should be expressed as RVR/VIS values not lower than those specified in Table 3, Take Off RVR/VIS.

For multi-engined airplanes without the performance to comply with the conditions mentioned above in the event of a critical engine failure, there may be a need to re-land immediately and to see and avoid obstacles in the take-off area. Such airplanes may be operated to the following take-off minimums provided they are able to comply with the applicable obstacle clearance criteria, assuming engine failure at the height specified.

The take-off minimums specified by the operator should be based upon the height from which the one-engine-inoperative (OEI) net take-off flight path can be constructed.

The RVR minimums used should not be lower than either of the values specified in Table 3, Take Off RVR/VIS or Table 4, Assumed Engine Failure Height above the Runway versus RVR/VIS.



TABLE 3. TAKE OFF RVR/VIS
FACILITIES | RVR/VIS
DAY ONLY – NIL | 500 m
DAY – At least runway edge lights or centerline marking | 400 m
NIGHT – at least runway edge lights and runway end lights or runway centerline lights and runway end lights | —



TABLE 4. TAKE OFF – ASSUMED ENG. FAIL HEIGHT ABOVE THE RWY VS. RVR/VIS
ASSUMED ENG. FAIL HEIGHT | RVR/VIS
≤ 50 ft | 400 m (200 m with LVTO approval)
51 ft – 100 ft | 400 m (300 m with LVTO approval)
101 ft – 150 ft | 400 m
151 ft – 200 ft | 500 m
201 ft – 300 ft | 1.000 m
More than 300 ft | 1.500 m

Note: 1.500 m is also applicable if no positive take-off flight path can be constructed.

As the C172SP is a single engine airplane, no positive take off path can be constructed after an engine failure, consequently the minimum take off RVR/VIS for all IFR training operations within EuroPilot Center will be 1.500 m.

For the DA42, the assumed Engine Failure Height is considered more than 300 ft, consequently the minimum take off RVR/VIS for all IFR training operations will be 1.500 m.

Note: The reported RVR/VIS value representative of the initial part of the take-off run can be replaced by pilot assessment.



4.2.5 Approach Minima
4.2.5.1 Aerodrome operating minima for NPA, APC, CAT I Operations (NCO.OP.111)
The decision height (DH) to be used for a non-precision approach (NPA) flown with the continuous descent final approach (CDFA) technique, approach procedure with vertical guidance (APV) or category I (CAT I) operation shall not be lower than the highest of:
• The minimum height to which the approach aid can be used without the required visual reference;
• The obstacle clearance height (OCH) for the category of aircraft;
• The published approach procedure DH where applicable;
• The system minimum specified in Table 1 (System Minima NCO.OP.111); or
• The minimum DH specified in the AFM or equivalent document, if stated.

The minimum descent height (MDH) for an NPA operation flown without the CDFA technique shall not be lower than the highest of:
• The OCH for the category of aircraft;
• The system minimum specified in Table 1 (System Minima NCO.OP.111) below; or
• The minimum MDH specified in the AFM, if stated.



TABLE 1. SYSTEM MINIMA NCO.OP.111
FACILITY | LOWEST DH/MDH (ft)
Instrument landing system (ILS) | 200 ft
GNSS / SBAS (LPV) | 200 ft
GNSS (LNAV) | 250 ft
GNSS / VNAV (LNAV/VNAV) | 250 ft
Localiser (LOC) with or without DME | 250 ft
Surveillance radar approach (SRA) (terminating at ½ NM) | 250 ft
SRA (terminating at 1 NM) | 300 ft
SRA (terminating at 2 NM or more) | 350 ft
VOR | 300 ft



TABLE 1. SYSTEM MINIMA NCO.OP.111 (continued)
FACILITY | LOWEST DH/MDH (ft)
VOR/DME | 250 ft
Non-directional beacon (NDB) | 350 ft
NDB/DME | 300 ft
VHF direction finder (VDF) | 350 ft

Note: The published Jeppesen Approach Minima will be used for all EuroPilot Center IFR Training Operations.



4.2.5.2 Continuous Descent Final Approach Procedure (CDFA)
The CDFA technique should ensure that an approach can be flown on the desired vertical path and track in a stabilized manner, without significant vertical path changes during the final approach segment descent to the runway.

This technique applies to an approach with no vertical guidance and controls the descent path until the DA/H.

This descent path can be either a:
• Recommended descent rate, based on estimated ground speed;
• Descent path depicted on the approach chart; or
• Descent path coded in the flight management system in accordance with the approach chart descent path.

Note: The published Jeppesen Charts used by EuroPilot Center will satisfy the requirement whereby the appropriate cross check altitudes/heights with the corresponding appropriate range information are shown. The Missed Approach Point (MAPt) is published on these chart.

Note: The required descent path should be flown to the DA/H, observing any step-down crossing altitudes if applicable.

Note: As this is a DA/H no add-on to the published Jeppesen Approach minimums is required.

Note: Standard Minima Callouts should be performed when approaching the DA/H.

Note: The missed approach should be initiated no later than reaching the MAPt or at the DA/H, whichever comes first. The lateral part of the missed approach should be flown via the MAPt unless otherwise stated on the approach chart.



4.2.5.3 Visual Approach
EuroPilot Center applies the Visual Approach Procedures based on AMC2 NCO.OP.110. The PIC shall not use an RVR of less than 800 m for a visual approach.



4.2.5.4 Conversion reported visibility to RVR
EuroPilot Center applies the Conversion of reported Visibility to RVR Procedure based on GM5 NCO.OP.110.

A conversion from meteorological visibility to RVR/CMV should not be used:
• When reported RVR is available;
• For calculating take-off minimums; and
• For any RVR minimums less than 800 m.

If the RVR is reported as being above the maximum value assessed by the aerodrome operator, e.g. “RVR more than 1.500 m”, it should not be considered as a reported value for as “When reported visibility is available”.

When converting meteorological visibility to RVR in circumstances other than those above, the conversion factors specified in the following table should be used:

Lighting elements in operation | RVR = Reported Met. Visibility ×
DAY | NIGHT
Hi approach and RWY lights | 1.5 | 2
Any type of lights other than above | 1 | 1.5
No lighting | 1 | Not Applicable



4.2.6 Noise Abatement Procedures (NCO.OP.120)
The PIC shall take into account published noise abatement procedures to minimize the effect of aircraft noise while ensuring that safety has priority over noise abatement.



4.2.7 Commencement and continuation of approach – Approach Ban (NCO.OP.210)
The PIC may commence an instrument approach regardless of the reported runway visual range/visibility (RVR/VIS).

If the reported RVR/VIS is less than the applicable minimum, the approach shall not be continued:
• Below 1.000 ft above the aerodrome; or
• Into the final approach segment in the case where the decision altitude/height (DA/H) or minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) is more than 1.000 ft above the aerodrome.

Where the RVR is not available, RVR values may be derived by converting the reported visibility as described under 4.2.5.4.

If, after passing 1.000 ft above the aerodrome, the reported RVR/VIS falls below the applicable minimum, the approach may be continued to DA/H or MDA/H.

The approach may be continued below DA/H or MDA/H and the landing may be completed provided that the visual reference adequate for the type of approach operation and for the intended runway is established at the DA/H or MDA/H and is maintained.

The touchdown zone RVR shall always be controlling.

4.3 VFR Training Flights (Solo)

The standard VMC minima apply for all VFR solo flights with the exception that the visibility must be at least 8 km.



4.4 Wind Limitations

Maximum Crosswind Component Cessna C172SP
The maximum crosswind component shall not exceed the maximum demonstrated crosswind component (Gusts excluded) of the applicable aircraft.
This is 15 Kts (Gust excluded) for the C172SP.

For VFR solo flights, the maximum crosswind component (Gust included) shall not exceed 10 kts.

Maximum Overall Wind Component Cessna C172SP
The maximum overall wind shall not exceed 29 Kts (Gusts included).

For VFR solo flights, the maximum overall wind (Gust included) shall not exceed 15 kts.

Maximum Wind Diamond DA42
The maximum crosswind component shall not exceed the maximum demonstrated crosswind component (Gusts excluded) of the applicable aircraft.
This is 20 Kts (Gust excluded) for the DA42.

Maximum Overall Wind Component Diamond DA42
The maximum overall wind shall not exceed 29 Kts (Gusts included).
