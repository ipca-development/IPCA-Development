AIRCRAFT HANDLING
Checklists
Use of Checklists

The standard way of operating the aircraft in single pilot operations is by means of checklists: There are 3 types of checklists:
Scan flows
Read and do
2. Recall

Scan flows
A scan flow is basically performed from Top to Bottom and from Left to Right.
Every single instrument and switch in the cockpit will be checked in a logical order and the necessary actions will be performed related to that particular phase of flight.
Scan flows can be performed both on the ground and in flight.
Read and Do
An item will be read out, thereafter the required action will be performed.
Read and Do checklists are ONLY performed on the ground (with the exception of specific Emergency Checklists).

Recall
Recall Checklists are performed by heart. All in-flight checklists are Recall. Therefore all Recall Checklists must be known by heart at all times.
Note: all of the above checklists must be carried out loud and clear (not in silence). Checklists are announced by e.g. “Before Start Checklist” and finished by e.g. “Before Start Checklist Completed”.

Checklist Overview
The following checklists will be performed:

Release to service after maintenance
No aircraft can be released to service unless a certificate of release to service is issued at the completion of any maintenance, when satisfied that all maintenance required has been properly carried out by appropriate certified staff on behalf of the maintenance organization approved in accordance with Section A, Subpart F of EASA Part M.
A certificate of release to service shall contain as a minimum:
Basic details of the maintenance carried out;
The date such maintenance was completed;
The identity of the organization and/or person issuing the release to service, including the approval reference of the maintenance organization approved in accordance with Section A, Subpart F of EASA Part M and the certifying staff issuing such a certificate;
The limitations to airworthiness or operations, if any.
The aircraft certificate of release to service should also contain the following statement:
“Certifies that the work specified except as otherwise specified was carried out in accordance with Part-M and in respect to that work the aircraft is considered ready for release to service”
The release to service will be added to the Aircraft Journey Log.
The Pilot In Command is responsible to verify the release to service document.
As a safety measure, the Pilot In Command who performed the last flight before the aircraft was handed over to the maintenance organization, shall:
Hand over both the Aircraft Journey Log + Aircraft Keys to the maintenance organization and;
Attach the red Maintenance Alert Placard to the yoke/stick indicating: “MAINTENANCE ACTIONS PERFORMED - CHECK RELEASE BEFORE FLIGHT.”




The maintenance organization will be informed not to remove the Maintenance Alert Placard. We refer te OM Annex 09 - Maintenance Alert Placard.

Aircraft Journey Logs
Logbook
In accordance with NCO.GEN.150, each journey shall be retained for each flight, or series of flights, in the form of a journey log, or equivalent.
The aircraft journey log, or equivalent, should include the following items, where applicable:
aircraft nationality and registration;
date;
name of crew member(s);
duty assignments of crew members, if applicable;
place of departure;
place of arrival;
time of departure;
time of arrival;
hours of flight;
nature of flight;
incidents and observations (if any); and
signature of the pilot-in-command.
The Journey logs (Logbooks) provided by the country of registration of the relevant aircraft, fulfill the requirements of the above shall be used within EuroPilot Center.
The aircraft journey log must be filled out by the flight instructor (or the student in case of solo flights).
Electronic Dispatch/Check-In System
The online scheduling system provides an electronic backup for the paper logbooks as mentioned under 2.5.1 and is used to record, distribute and communicate important flight data to the EuroPilot Center administration, including:
Flight- and instruction times;
Maintenance follow-up;
Trouble report items (squawks);
Fuel consumption;
Instructor and Student duty times;
Special remarks (e.g. landing fee’s);
The system is network based, available on every public computer at the EuroPilot Center premises.
Before each training session, the instructor is responsible for “dispatching” the flight by verifying the Hobbs and/or Tacho times entered by the previous pilot and the expected fuel and oil on board.
Immediately after each training session, the instructor is responsible for “checking the flight in”. He should enter the Hobbs and/or Tacho times, the remaining fuel and oil, the flight- and ground instruction times and trouble report items (if any). This task may be delegated to an Operations Officer, but the final responsibility remains with the instructor.
Note: The system automatically corrects for entry errors. If an error has been entered despite the auto-verification, the person responsible should contact the Operations Officer immediately, explaining the issue in order to rectify the error manually.

Technical Logs
Aircraft defect reporting
All aircraft defects must be reported immediately before, during or after the flight by the Pilot In Command in the applicable paper Aircraft Trouble Report and via the electronic check in process as explained under. 2.5.2.
Any deferred aircraft defect should be reported by the responsible maintenance engineer in the applicable paper and electronic Aircraft Trouble Report. When an item has been repaired, it must be signed off by the maintenance engineer including a description of the action taken.
It remains the responsibility of the Pilot In Command to check the paper and electronic Trouble Report before each flight in order to assess the airworthiness requirements for the intended day/night/VFR or IFR operation.

MINIMUM EQUIPMENT LIST (MEL)
EuroPilot Center does not apply operational procedures in accordance with 2T155 and NCO.IDE.A.105 to dispatch an aircraft with inoperative equipment through a Minimum Equipment List (MEL).
Alternatively, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2042/2003, M.A.403, any defect that hazards seriously the flight safety shall be rectified before further flight. Only the authorized certifying staff (maintenance engineers) can decide, whether an aircraft defect hazards seriously the flight safety and therefore decide when and which rectification action shall be taken before further flight and which defect rectification can be deferred.
Any aircraft defect that would not hazard seriously the flight safety shall be rectified as soon as practicable, after the date the aircraft defect was first identified and within any limits specified in the maintenance data.
Any defect not rectified before flight shall be recorded in the aircraft maintenance record system and all deferred defects should be made known to the pilot/flight crew via the paper and electronic trouble report as described under Paragraph 2.6.
Deferred defects should be transferred by maintenance on to worksheets at the next appropriate maintenance check, and any deferred defect which is not rectified during the maintenance check, should be re- entered on to a new deferred defect record sheet.
The original date of the defect should be retained. The necessary components or parts needed for the rectification of defects should be made available or ordered on a priority basis, and fitted at the earliest opportunity.
Note: As EuroPilot Center has no MEL procedure in place, the decision to defer an aircraft defect cannot be taken by the Pilot In Command, but must be taken by an authorized maintenance engineer. The decision to dispatch the aircraft after an item has been deferred lies with the Pilot In Command.
