11.3 EDP Back-up Concept

For all electronic files and documents, if any, EuroPilot Center shall provide a back-up in accordance with EASA ORA.GEN.220 and ORA.ATO.120:

• The responsibility for such back-up lies with the Accountable Manager;
• The back-ups will be taken on a Quarterly basis;
• The back-ups will be stored in a different location from that containing the working data and in an environment that ensures they remain in good condition. The EuroPilot Center Administration archives will satisfy this requirement, currently located at Antwerp Airport Office 2.

• All data should be kept for a period of at least 5 years:
a) details of ground, flight, and simulated flight training given to individual students;
b) detailed and regular progress reports from instructors including assessments, and regular progress flight tests and ground examinations; and
c) information on the licenses and associated ratings and certificates of the students, including the expiry dates of medical certificates and ratings.

• When hardware or software changes take place, special care should be taken that all necessary data continues to be accessible for at least 5 years.

• Other data then the one specified above, should be kept for a period of at least 5 years.



12. FSTD COMPLIANCE MONITORING MEASURES



12.1 Purpose

For the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of the FSTD Compliance Monitoring System, EuroPilot Center applies simplified performance measures that can be monitored against the FSTD Compliance Monitoring Objectives. These measures, referred to as Metrics can be reviewed by the BCAA as part of their oversight of Compliance Monitoring System and will be examined for each FSTD on an annual basis.

The FSTD Compliance Monitoring Objectives are published in the Annual Company Goals by the Accountable Manager.



12.2 FSTD Metrics

All FSTD times must be recorded in the Annual FSTD Logbook. We refer to Annex 5.



12.2.1 FSTD Actual Operating Time
The actual time the FSTD is operational, recorded in the FSTD Logbook under column “A-TIME” (meaning Actual Operating Time).



12.2.2 FSTD Defects

An FSTD defect is any unanticipated occurrence which causes an operationally significant period during which the FSTD cannot be used within the specified tolerances.

FSTD defects will result in Training Sessions Interruptions and consequently result in a Downtime Period.

The Downtime Period will be recorded in the FSTD Logbook under the column “D-TIME” (meaning Downtime) in case of a scheduled Training Session Interruption caused by an FSTD Defect.

The total number of FSTD defects leading to a Training Session Interruption, resulting in a Downtime Period must be recorded at the bottom of each FSTD Logbook page.




12.2.3 FSTD Availability

The FSTD availability is determined on a yearly basis by the ratio of Actual Operating Time compared to Specified Operating Time.

The Specified Operating Time can be calculated by the sum of the total time of column “A-TIME” and the total time of column “D-TIME”.

The FSTD Availability can be calculated by the following formula:

Annual Actual Operating Time
FSTD AVAILABILITY = —————————— × 100
Annual Specified Operating Time

Note: the FSTD Availability is one of the FSTD Compliance Monitoring Objectives.




12.2.4 Mean Time Between Failures

The FSTD Mean Time Between Failures is determined on a yearly basis by the ratio of the Actual Operating Time and the number of FSTD Defects.

It can be calculated by the following formula:

Actual Operating Time
FSTD MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES = ——————————
Number of FSTD Defects



12.2.5 FSTD Reliability

The FSTD reliability is the probability that the specific installation operates within the specified tolerances and refers to the probability that the facility will operate for a specified period of time.

It corresponds to the Mean Time Between Failure value.

Note: the FSTD Reliability is one of the FSTD Compliance Monitoring Objectives.

Factors which affect MTBF and hence facility reliability are:

• Inherent equipment reliability;
• Degree and type of redundancy;
• Reliability of the serving utilities such as power and telephone or control lines;
• Degree and Compliance Monitoring of maintenance;
• Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.




12.2.6 Major FSTD Issues

In case of an FSTD:

• Major change;
• Relocation;
• Deactivation;
• Major failure;
• Major safety issue associated with the installation.

The BCAA shall be informed by e-mail immediately by the FSTD Compliance Monitoring Manager and discuss the appropriate actions required.




13. REGULATORY CHANGES FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES

The purpose of the below Regulatory follow-up procedure is to maintain compliance with ORA.GEN.135.

By integrating a monthly Regulatory Change follow-up procedure, the CMM will be required to perform the following tasks:

• Enroll in the official EASA and FAA Online Notification Services (we refer to Annex 26 for more details).
• Daily, receives/collects all Regulatory changes relevant to the ATO (we refer to Annex 26 for a detailed overview of all relevant Regulations pertaining to the organization in Belgium and the USA).
• As part of the Scope, executes a manual verification of the Regulations relevant to the ATO (we refer to Annex 26).
• Publishes a “Regulatory Changes Bulletin” on a monthly basis which should be sent to the AM, HT and SM via e-mail.
• Depending on a) the nature; and/or b) the urgency of a future Regulatory Change, the CMM can call for a “Regulatory Change Meeting“, to be attended by the AM, HT and SM.
• Creation of an “Action Plan Proposal” to the AM, HT and SM.

The process consists of 4 phases:

PHASE 1 – Actively Monitoring Regulatory Changes
PHASE 2 – Analyzing Changes
PHASE 3 – Drafting Bulletin & Action Planning
PHASE 4 – Closing



13.1 Phase 1 – Actively Monitoring Regulatory Changes


• Login to PipeDrive and Click on “Projects”.
• From the Dropdown list on the right, select the “CMM - Regulatory Changes” -Project.
• Click on “plus symbol” located inside the first Phase of the Project (or the Green “+ Project” button on the left).
• Select the “Regulator Changes” Template.
• Name the Project as per following convention: “Regulatory Changes: MM/YYYY” (e.g. Regulatory Changes: 02/2023”).
• Enter “Start Date” (Should be the first day of the month).
• Enter “End Date” (Should be the last day of the month).
• Select Label” In Progress”.
• Perform the checklist items under the “PLAN” section of the Project.
• When receiving relevant regulatory changes containing a PDF file or other document, the CMM must upload this document via the “FILES” section of the Project.
• Upon receiving relevant regulatory changes via ANY official SOURCE, a note must be made in the “NOTES” Section of the Project, including comments.
• When receiving relevant e-mails from official sources, they should be linked to the Project by opening the e-mail in PipeDrive, on the right, enter the Project Name in the textfield underneath the “Link to a deal/lead/project” -box.



13.2 Phase 2 – Analyzing Changes

• Go to the Project section in Pipedrive to obtain all the data collected during Phase 1.
• Move the Project to Phase 2.
• Start with the Analysis Process based on the PLAN Checklist for this Phase.
• Update the overview of all relevant Regulatory Changes in the “NOTES” section of the Project, already made during Phase 1.



13.3 Phase 3 – Drafting Bulletin & Action Planning


• Go to the Project section in Pipedrive.
• Move the Project to Phase 3.
• Execute the PLAN Checklist for this Phase.
• Start drafting the “Regulatory Changes Bulletin” via de “EMAILS” section of the Project by creating a new e-mail via the Template Menu. Select the “Regulatory Change Bulletin” template.
• Create an Action Plan via the “PLAN” Section.
• Select a “TASK” for each Action Item requiring a Task to be fulfilled, add sub-tasks if required.
• Allocate the “TASK” to the responsible person within the organization and add a due-date (proposal).
• Only select “ACTIVITY” when a certain Action requires a Calendar event such as a Meeting etc.
• Once the Regulatory Changes Bulletin (or Minutes of the Regulatory Changes Meeting, if held) has been drafted and the Action Plan is prepared under the PLAN section, send the e-mail to the AM, HT, SM.



13.4 Phase 4 – Closing

• After either the “Regulatory Changes Bulletin” or the Minutes of “Regulatory Changes Meeting” have been reviewed by the AM, HT and SM, feedback obtained shall be used to update the Action Plan via the “PLAN” Section.
• Based on the deadlines for each Action item, the CMM shall follow-up with the person to whom the Task was allocated. Pipedrive will generate automatic triggers if required.
• The CMM ensures all Task Items are closed and “archives” the Project.
